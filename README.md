# Design Pattern With Simple Example

## Creational Pattern
### - Factory Pattern
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
Defining a "virtual" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.

### - Abstract Factory Pattern
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
The new operator considered harmful.

### - Builder Pattern
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.

### - Opject Pool Pattern
Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low.

### - Prototype Pattern
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future instances.
The new operator considered harmful.
[https://github.com/maiermarc75/design_pattern/blob/main/patterns/prototype.py](https://github.com/maiermarc75/design_pattern/blob/main/patterns/prototype.py)
### - Singleton Pattern
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".
